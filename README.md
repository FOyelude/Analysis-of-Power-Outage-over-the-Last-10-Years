# 📌<a id="introduction">Introduction</a>

Every modern economy depends on a stable, resilient, and well-managed power grid. Over the past decade, however, the U.S. grid has faced growing pressure from multiple sources, including extreme weather events, ageing infrastructure, equipment failures, supply–demand imbalances, and intentional attacks.

These disruptions do far more than simply turn off the lights. They disrupt business operations, damage critical infrastructure, compromise national energy security, and result in millions of dollars in lost productivity. In extreme conditions, outages also pose serious threats to public safety.

In this context, outage data is not just numerical information. It represents the stability of the energy backbone that powers homes, industries, hospitals, and entire communities. Understanding these patterns is crucial for developing a grid that can withstand current and future challenges.

---

# 📌 <a id ="problemstatement">Problem Statement</a>

The U.S. power grid is experiencing more frequent and more severe outages, driven by both natural and human-related factors. Yet utilities, regulators, and policymakers often lack a clear, data-driven understanding of:

* **Why outages occur**
* **How their frequency has changed**
* **Which events cause the longest downtimes**
* **Which regions are most vulnerable**
* **Which outages are preventable or unavoidable**

Without this clarity, investments are misaligned, response strategies underperform, and risks accumulate across the system.

This report analyses **10 years of NERC outage data** to uncover the root causes of disruptions and identify meaningful trends. The aim is to transform raw outage logs into actionable insights that help stakeholders:

* improve grid reliability,
* prioritise infrastructure upgrades,
* reduce downtime and operational losses,
* enhance disaster and attack preparedness, and
* develop evidence-based policies rather than reactive measures.

We are not analysing the past just to describe it, we are analysing it to **help prevent the next major outage**.

# 📌 <a id = "executivesummary">Executive Summary</a>
The U.S. power grid is facing mounting pressure from **multiple, rapidly evolving threats**. Over the past decade, outage frequency has surged, driven by a combination of **extreme weather, rising physical attacks, operational strain, and supply–demand stress**. These disruptions now pose significant risks to national reliability, economic stability, and public confidence.

Our analysis of ten years of outage data shows that **weather and natural disasters remain the leading cause**, responsible for **35.3% of all recorded events** nationwide. However, **physical attacks and vandalism have emerged as a close second**, contributing **30.7%** of all events. In the **WECC region**, nearly **half of all outages (47.7%)** are caused by physical attacks, making it one of the most significant security vulnerabilities in the country.

While natural and intentional threats dominate, operational issues are also worsening. **Human and procedural errors have risen by 108% since 2018**, indicating growing stress on grid operations, workforce capability, and procedural discipline.

The severity of outages is amplified by the changing nature of grid stress. **Supply–demand imbalances now produce the longest downtimes**, averaging **15 days per event** and accounting for **nearly 70% of total demand loss**. Regions such as **NPCC and MRO** experience the longest recovery periods, exposing weaknesses in forecasting accuracy, reserve margins, and interconnection flexibility.

Customer impact is highest in **WECC, SERC, and TRE**, which collectively account for the majority of affected households. **WECC alone represents nearly 30% of all impacted customers**, primarily driven by weather-related events and physical attacks.

Overall, the findings reveal a grid that is **structurally vulnerable, operationally strained, and increasingly exposed to both natural and man-made threats**. Strengthening the system will require coordinated investment across four priorities:

* **Climate-resilient infrastructure**
* **Enhanced physical security**
* **Modernised operational and workforce practices**
* **Smarter supply–demand planning and response systems**

This analysis provides a **clear roadmap** for utilities, regulators, and policymakers to reduce outage risk, shorten recovery times, and build a more resilient national power grid capable of meeting the demands of the next decade.

# <a id = "keyfindings">Key Findings</a>
## 📌 <a id = "insight1">**INSIGHT 1 — The Grid Is Losing a Two-Front War: Extreme Weather and Physical Attacks**</a>

### **Story**

A decade-long review of US outage data reveals a clear pattern:
**Weather/Natural Disasters (35.3%)** and **Vandalism/Physical Attacks (30.7%)** (see Fig. 2) are the two leading causes of grid disruptions nationwide. Although weather remains the primary driver, the gap between the two threats is surprisingly narrow, making both **critical risks to grid stability**.

Across many regions, weather overwhelmingly dominates, especially in **SERC**, where nearly **30%** (see fig 3) of all outages stem from storms, heatwaves, and natural disasters. **WECC** and **TRE** follow closely, showing clear signs of climate vulnerability and ageing infrastructure.

The other emerging threat is physical security. **WECC alone accounts for almost 50% of all vandalism and physical attack incidents** (see fig 4), making it the epicentre of intentional grid disruption and lack of effective security personnel, if any. Bad Weather might not be so easy to control, but vandalism can certainly be disrupted. 

---

### **Why This Matters**

These trends reveal a grid facing pressure from **both nature and people**:

* Weather events are becoming more frequent and intense
* Intentional attacks demonstrate increasing coordination and severity

Together, these vulnerabilities create a threat to grid reliability.

For utilities and regulators, this means:

* Infrastructure must be hardened against extreme weather by **installing flood barriers** and **weather sensors**
* Physical security systems such as **CCTV cameras**, **perimeter fencing** must be upgraded, starting with WECC
* Investment priorities must shift from reactive repairs to **proactive resilience**

---

### **Problem Statement**

The grid is **not adequately protected against its two biggest threats: severe weather and physical attacks**.
Climate resilience is weakest in **SERC**, **WECC**, and **TRE**, while **WECC experiences half of all vandalism incidents**.

Without targeted investment in **weather-proofing and security upgrades, outages will continue to rise in both frequency and severity.

---

## 📌 <a id = "insight2">INSIGHT 2 — Human Error–Related Outages Have Increased by 108% Since 2018</a>

### Story

While weather and vandalism remain major contributors to outages, **human error has emerged as a rapidly growing threat** (see Fig. 2) . Since 2018, outages caused by operational mistakes have increased by **108%** (see Fig. 5), making it one of the fastest-rising contributors to grid disruptions.

This rise is significant because it comes at a time when outage frequency across all categories has already grown sharply — **90.5% in the last 5 years** and **139.4% over 10 years**. The data suggests not only external pressure on the grid, but also **internal operational weaknesses** within teams responsible for system oversight and maintenance.

---

### Why This Matters

Human-driven outages are **100% preventable**, yet their rapid growth shows systemic issues such as:

* Inadequate training or outdated procedures due to lack of weekly forums and seminars, lack of mandatory quarterly certifications for operators  and so on 
* Fatigue and understaffing during high-demand periods
* Poor documentation or lack of standardised protocols
* Insufficient oversight during equipment handling and switching due to a lack of dual-operator verification

Unlike weather or vandalism, human error reflects **operational discipline**, and the increase signals that teams may be overworked or processes may not be keeping up with grid complexity.

---

### Problem Statement

The rising rate of **human-error outages indicates operational gaps** that must be addressed. Utilities need **stronger training programs, clearer operating procedures, digital checklists, and real-time monitoring systems** to reduce preventable disruptions.

---


## 📌 <a id = "insight3">INSIGHT 3 — Vandalism is a Critical and Growing Threat, especially in the WECC region (48.2% of Vandalism Outages)</a>

### Story

While weather dominates outage frequency nationally, **vandalism has quietly become one of the most destabilising man-made threats to the grid** — and certain regions are feeling the impact disproportionately.

Across all regions, vandalism accounts for a significant share of outages, but in the **WECC** region, it is the dominant driver, where almost **50% of all outages** occurred — the highest concentration in the country and representing **14.86% of all outages recorded nationwide** (see Fig. 6).

**SERC** region also shows high vulnerability, with **15.34%** of vandalism outages occurring (see Fig. 4). These are not isolated events; they form a pattern severe enough to raise concerns about **infrastructure security** and **regulatory preparedness**.

---

### Why This Matters

Vandalism-driven outages are different from weather or equipment failures — they represent **intentional attacks on critical energy infrastructure**. Their consequences extend far beyond downtime:

* Expose security weaknesses within critical grid facilities
* Create high financial losses due to equipment damage, not just downtime
* Increase risk to field personnel responding to unsafe environments
* Demonstrate how easily the power supply can be deliberately disrupted

Given that **WECC** handles a large portion of U.S. energy distribution across vast rural areas, these attacks suggest that many sites remain **under-secured, unmonitored, or physically isolated**, making them vulnerable to exploitation.

---

### Problem Statement

The persistence of **vandalism indicates that utilities must strengthen physical security** — from surveillance and access control to rapid-response protocols — especially in high-risk regions like **WECC and SERC**. Without intervention, **intentional disruptions will continue to undermine grid reliability and public safety**.

## 📌 <a id = "insight4">INSIGHT 4 — Supply & Demand Issues cause downtimes of up to an alarming 15 Days</a>

### Story

Not all outages are equal. Some last minutes, others last hours, but a specific category called High downtimes consistently pushes the grid into **multi-week or multi-month  recovery efforts**: **Supply and Demand Issues**.

Over the last 10 years, these events have proven to be one of the major drivers of high-downtime outages, responsible for:

* **39.3% of all high-downtime events** (more than a week) (see Fig. 7)
* **An average recovery time of 15 days** across high downtime events, the highest among all event types (Fig. 8)
* **69.4% of total demand loss** associated with high downtime events, indicating significant strain on system capacity (Fig. 9)

Among the only 5 very high downtime events (regarded as outlier events) that have occurred, 4 (80%) have been caused by Supply and Demand Issues (Fig. 13)

Compared to weather events (**11 days MTTR**) or vandalism (**14 days MTTR**), supply-demand imbalance is uniquely damaging because recovery often requires **system-wide recalibration**, not just fixing physical equipment.

To avoid supply and demand issues, regions where they frequently occur need to be identified and addressed. Considering both Outage Frequency and MTTR.The region to be initially improved on includes:

* **MRO**: 6.33 days MTTR, 12 occurrences
* **NPCC**: 8.67 MTTR, 10 occurrences
(See Figs. 11 and 12)

This highlights a deeper issue: the grid is struggling not only with external threats, but also with **internal instability rooted in ageing infrastructure, peak-demand spikes, and insufficient reserve generation**.

---

### Why This Matters

High-downtime events are the **most costly outages** for utilities and communities. They:

* Disrupt critical services for long periods
* Lead to major financial losses in commerce and industry
* Increase the risk of cascading failures in the grid
* Indicate deeper structural weaknesses in power generation or transmission planning

A **15-day average recovery time** signals that U.S. grid capacity is **under-prepared for sudden spikes or drops in power balance** — a problem that will intensify as energy demand grows and climate-driven peak loads become more unpredictable.

---

# 🔚 <a id = "conclusion">Conclusion</a>

Ten years of U.S. outage data reveal a simple truth: the power grid is under growing pressure from **multiple and increasingly severe threats**. While extreme weather remains the leading disruptor, the sharp rise in **human errors, supply–demand stress, and physical attacks** shows that vulnerabilities now extend well beyond natural causes.

These disruptions carry real consequences—**long outages, high economic losses, and declining public confidence**. However, the data also shows that many of these failures are **avoidable**. With targeted investments in **weather-resilient infrastructure, smarter forecasting, improved operational discipline, and stronger grid security**, utilities can significantly cut both outage frequency and recovery time.

More responsive restoration systems and transparent customer communication will further reduce the impact when failures occur.

Ultimately, this analysis is not just a record of where the grid has failed—it's a **playbook for strengthening it**. By acting on these insights, regulators and utilities can build a grid that is **more reliable, more adaptive, and better prepared** for the challenges of the next decade.
