# Analysis of Power Outage over the Last 10 Years


---

# 📌 Introduction

Every modern economy depends on a stable, resilient, and well-managed power grid. Over the past decade, however, the U.S. grid has faced growing pressure from multiple sources—extreme weather events, aging infrastructure, equipment failures, supply–demand imbalances, and intentional attacks.

These disruptions do far more than simply turn off the lights. They interrupt business operations, damage critical infrastructure, weaken national energy security, and cost millions in lost productivity. In extreme conditions, outages also pose serious threats to public safety.

In this context, outage data is not just numerical information. It represents the stability of the energy backbone that powers homes, industries, hospitals, and entire communities. Understanding these patterns is essential for building a grid capable of withstanding current and future challenges.

---

# 📌 Problem Statement

The U.S. power grid is experiencing more frequent and more severe outages, driven by both natural and human-related factors. Yet utilities, regulators, and policymakers often lack a clear, data-driven understanding of:

* **Why outages occur**
* **How their frequency has changed**
* **Which events cause the longest downtimes**
* **Which regions are most vulnerable**
* **Which outages are preventable vs. unavoidable**

Without this clarity, investments are misaligned, response strategies underperform, and risks accumulate across the system.

This report analyzes **10 years of NERC outage data** to uncover the root causes of disruptions and identify meaningful trends. The aim is to transform raw outage logs into actionable insights that help stakeholders:

* improve grid reliability,
* prioritize infrastructure upgrades,
* reduce downtime and operational losses,
* enhance disaster and attack preparedness, and
* develop evidence-based policies rather than reactive measures.

We are not analyzing the past just to describe it—we are analyzing it to **help prevent the next major outage**.

# 📌 Executive Summary

The stability of the U.S. power grid is under increasing pressure. Over the last decade, **outage frequency has risen sharply — up 139%** — driven primarily by extreme weather, growing security threats, and aging infrastructure. These outages disrupt businesses, weaken energy security, and expose critical vulnerabilities across the electric system.

Our analysis of ten years of national outage data reveals that **weather remains the single largest driver of grid disruption**, responsible for **54.6% of all events** and **65.3% of total downtime days**. Regions such as **SERC, WECC, and TRE** face the greatest exposure, highlighting the need for targeted infrastructure reinforcement and climate-resilient upgrades.

Beyond natural hazards, the grid faces a rising threat from **intentional attacks**. Vandalism and physical assaults account for nearly half of outages in the **WECC** region alone and represent a growing national risk. **Human and operational errors** have also increased by **108% since 2018**, suggesting systemic strain within grid operations.

The consequences extend beyond frequency. **Supply and demand imbalances now produce the longest downtimes**, averaging **15 days per event** and causing nearly **70% of total demand loss**. Regions like **NPCC and MRO** show particularly long recovery times, indicating critical weaknesses in load management and grid flexibility.

Customer impact is most pronounced in **WECC, SERC, and TRE**, where outages affect the highest number of people. In **WECC alone**, nearly **30% of all affected customers** reside, primarily due to weather-related events.

Overall, the findings underscore a grid that is increasingly vulnerable, both structurally and operationally. **Strengthening infrastructure, improving demand-supply forecasting, enhancing cyber-physical security, and modernizing operational processes** will be essential to building a more resilient and reliable energy future.

This analysis provides **utilities, regulators, and policymakers** with the evidence needed to prioritize investments, reduce downtime, and mitigate the growing risks affecting millions of customers nationwide.

# 📌 INSIGHT 1 — Weather Is the Primary Driver of Outages, Causing 54.6% of All Events Over 10 Years

### Story

Over the last decade, **weather-related disruptions have consistently remained the top cause of outages**, accounting for **54.6% of all recorded events**. In the last 5 years alone, overall outage frequency has risen by **90.5%**, and weather continues to be a major contributor to this trend.

Regions such as **SERC** and **WECC** have experienced the heaviest impact, with weather responsible for the majority of outages in these areas. Even as other risks—such as vandalism and human error—grow, **weather consistently remains the most dominant threat to grid stability**.

---

### Why This Matters

Weather-related outages are highly unpredictable and often cause **long downtimes**. Their increasing frequency suggests that grid infrastructure is not adequately built for today’s climate conditions, leading to:

* Higher restoration costs
* Increased customer downtime
* Greater strain on emergency response teams
* Higher operational losses for businesses and utilities

This pattern indicates that **climate-resilient infrastructure investment is now a necessity, not an option**.

---

### Chart Reference

*(See Figure 1: Outages by Event Category, 2013–2022)*

---

### Problem Statement

The grid **lacks sufficient weather-resilient infrastructure**, especially in high-risk regions like **SERC** and **WECC**. Without targeted reinforcement, outages caused by storms, heatwaves, and natural disasters will continue to rise.


---

# 📌 INSIGHT 2 — Human Error–Related Outages Have Increased by 108% Since 2018

### Story

While weather and vandalism remain major contributors to outages, **human error has emerged as a rapidly growing threat**. Since 2018, outages caused by operational mistakes have increased by **108%**, making it one of the fastest-rising contributors to grid disruptions.

This rise is significant because it comes at a time when outage frequency across all categories has already grown sharply — **90.5% in the last 5 years** and **139.4% over 10 years**. The data suggests not only external pressure on the grid, but also **internal operational weaknesses** within teams responsible for system oversight and maintenance.

---

### Why This Matters

Human-driven outages are **100% preventable**, yet their rapid growth shows systemic issues such as:

* Inadequate training or outdated procedures
* Fatigue and understaffing during high-demand periods
* Poor documentation or lack of standardized protocols
* Insufficient oversight during equipment handling and switching

Unlike weather or vandalism, human error reflects **operational discipline**, and the increase signals that teams may be overstretched or processes may not be keeping up with grid complexity.

If not addressed, this trend can cause **unnecessary downtime, safety risks, and costly avoidable incidents**.

---

### Chart Reference

*(See Figure 2: Outage Frequency by Cause, 2013–2022)*

---

### Problem Statement

The rising rate of **human-error outages indicates operational gaps** that must be closed. Utilities need **stronger training programs, clearer operating procedures, digital checklists, and real-time monitoring systems** to reduce preventable disruptions.

---


# 📌 INSIGHT 3 — Vandalism Is a Critical and Growing Threat, Especially in WECC (47.7% of Outages)

### Story

While weather dominates outage frequency nationally, **vandalism has quietly become one of the most destabilizing man-made threats to the grid** — and certain regions are feeling the impact disproportionately.

Across all regions, vandalism accounts for a significant share of outages, but in the **WECC** region, it is the dominant driver, responsible for **47.7% of all outages** — the highest concentration in the country and representing **15.6% of all outages recorded nationwide**.

**SERC** and **TRE** also show high vulnerability, with vandalism causing **23.5%** and **20%** of outages respectively. These are not isolated events; they form a pattern severe enough to raise concerns about **infrastructure security** and **regulatory preparedness**.

---

### Why This Matters

Vandalism-driven outages are different from weather or equipment failures — they represent **intentional attacks on critical energy infrastructure**. Their consequences extend far beyond downtime:

* Expose security weaknesses within critical grid facilities
* Create high financial losses due to equipment damage, not just downtime
* Increase risk to field personnel responding to unsafe environments
* Demonstrate how easily the power supply can be deliberately disrupted

Given that **WECC** handles a large portion of U.S. energy distribution across vast rural areas, these attacks suggest that many sites remain **under-secured, unmonitored, or physically isolated**, making them easy targets.

---

### Chart Reference

*(See Figure 3: Vandalism Contribution to Outages by Region)*

---

### Problem Statement

The persistence of **vandalism indicates that utilities must strengthen physical security** — from surveillance and access control to rapid-response protocols — especially in high-risk regions like **WECC, SERC, and TRE**. Without intervention, **intentional disruptions will continue to undermine grid reliability and public safety**.

# 📌 INSIGHT 4 — Supply & Demand Issues Cause the Most Severe Downtimes (Up to 15 Days MTTR)

### Story

Not all outages are equal. Some last minutes, others last hours — but a specific category consistently pushes the grid into **multi-day or multi-week recovery efforts**: **Supply and Demand Issues**.

Over the last 10 years, these events have proven to be one of the major drivers of high-downtime outages, responsible for:

* **44.3% of all high-downtime events** (more than a week)
* **An average recovery time of 15 days**, the highest among all event types
* **69.4% of total demand loss**, indicating significant strain on system capacity

Compared to weather events (**11 days MTTR**) or vandalism (**14 days MTTR**), supply-demand imbalance is uniquely damaging because recovery often requires **system-wide recalibration**, not just fixing physical equipment.

The regions most affected by supply and demand issues are:

* **NPCC**: 8.7 days MTTR (5 occurrences out of total high-downtime events in the last 10 years)
* **MRO**: 6.3 days MTTR
* **TRE**: [days MTTR, 9 occurrences]
* **WECC**: 6 occurrences

This highlights a deeper issue: the grid is struggling not only with external threats, but **internal instability rooted in aging infrastructure, peak-demand spikes, and insufficient reserve generation**.

---

### Why This Matters

High-downtime events are the **costliest outages** for utilities and communities. They:

* Disrupt critical services for long periods
* Lead to major financial losses in commerce and industry
* Increase the risk of cascading failures in the grid
* Indicate deeper structural weaknesses in power generation or transmission planning

A **15-day average recovery time** signals that U.S. grid capacity is **under-prepared for sudden spikes or drops in power balance** — a problem that will intensify as energy demand grows and climate-driven peak loads become more unpredictable.

---

### Chart Reference

*(See Figure 4: Event Categories vs. Average Downtime & Demand Loss)*

---

### Problem Statement

To reduce prolonged outages, utilities must invest in **demand forecasting models, Grid modernization, Load-balancing technologies. Prioritizing NPCC, WPCC, and TRE** would yield the fastest improvements because they consistently experience **high recovery delays**.
